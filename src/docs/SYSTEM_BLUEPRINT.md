# Project Brief: Build the "NovaEd" AI Learning App

## 1. Core Application Concept:

You are to build a web application called **NovaEd**, a personalized AI-powered home learning platform. The app is designed to feel like a fun, engaging game, with a friendly AI tutor guiding a student through various academic subjects. The entire user interface should have a modern, dark theme with vibrant blue and purple accents.

## 2. Key Pages & User Flow:

The application should have the following pages and a clear, linear user flow:

*   **Login Page:** This is the entry point of the app. It should feature a standard email and password form. For now, this is a placeholder; any input should allow the user to proceed to the dashboard. Include a "Forgot Password?" link.
*   **Forgot Password Page:** A simple screen with an email input and a "Send Reset Link" button. This is also a placeholder.
*   **Dashboard:** The central hub after login. It should greet the user and display the "Next Lesson" for the day based on a hardcoded weekly schedule (Timetable). The user can start the lesson or skip it. If all lessons for the day are done, it should display a congratulatory message and a link to "Free Play" mode. The dashboard should also feature a button to view the full weekly timetable in a pop-up modal.
*   **Subjects & Curriculum Page:** This page allows the user to explore the full curriculum for every subject. It should feature a dropdown to select a subject. Upon selection, display all the lessons for that subject in a table, showing their title, description, and status (e.g., "Completed," "Current," "Upcoming").
*   **Progress Page:** A visual report of the student's learning history. It should display a card for each completed lesson, showing the topic, subject, a summary from the tutor, mastery status ("Mastered" or "Needs Review"), and XP earned. Include a dropdown to filter progress by subject.
*   **Free Play Page:** This page displays all available subjects as cards. The user can select any subject to start a lesson on demand, outside of the structured daily timetable.
*   **Profile Page:** Allows the user to set their preferences. The key setting here is the "Tutor Theme," with two options: "Mario" (enthusiastic and encouraging) or "Sonic" (cool and fast-paced). This choice should be saved locally in the browser.
*   **Tutor Prompts & Lesson Structure Pages:** Two static, informational pages that display the pre-written text of the prompts that define the AI tutor's personality and the rules governing its lesson flow. This is for transparency and educational purposes.
*   **Chat Page:** The core learning interface. This page is where the student interacts with the AI tutor. It must have:
    *   A clean, modern chat interface with messages from the "user" and the "assistant" (tutor).
    *   A message input box and a "Send" button.
    *   An "End Lesson" button to finish the session and return to the dashboard.
    *   A slide-out scientific calculator for use during lessons.

## 3. AI Tutor & Core Logic:

The centerpiece of the app is the AI tutor, "Nova."

*   **Tutor Personalities:** The tutor's personality is determined by the theme selected on the Profile page ("Mario" or "Sonic"). The core prompt should dynamically insert the selected personality instructions.
*   **Structured Dialogue:** The AI's conversation is not free-form. It must follow a strict set of rules: ask one question at a time, keep responses short, and provide multiple-choice options for simple user replies to guide the conversation.
*   **Gamification:** The tutor awards experience points (XP) for correct answers and provides encouraging, themed feedback.
*   **Lesson Start:** When a lesson begins, the AI should provide a friendly welcome message and a "Let's Go!" button to initiate the conversation.
*   **Lesson End:** When the "End Lesson" button is clicked, the AI should generate a structured summary of the session, including mastery status and XP earned. This summary should be displayed to the user.

## 4. Data Management (Simulated):

*   **Curriculum:** The subjects, lessons, and their order should be hardcoded within the application's data files. There should be at least seven subjects (e.g., Maths, Physics, Biology, English) with multiple lessons each.
*   **Progress:** All user progress (completed lessons, XP) is simulated. When a lesson ends, a summary is generated by the AI but not persistently stored in a database. The Progress page should display hardcoded dummy data.
*   **Daily Schedule:** The daily lesson plan on the dashboard is driven by a hardcoded timetable, mapping days of the week to a sequence of subjects.
