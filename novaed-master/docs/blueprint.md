## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4), projecting a professional, trustworthy, yet still youthful and engaging image, which are traits well aligned to this product. This color provides excellent contrast against a white background, while being far from the overused default 'teal'.
- Background color: Light gray (#F1F3F4), offering a neutral and clean backdrop that is easy on the eyes.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF5722), used to highlight important interactive elements and CTAs (call-to-actions) in the app.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a balance of warmth and readability.
- Use clear, consistent icons related to the subjects; maths, science, english to guide students in each section.
- A well-structured layout with clear sections for easy navigation, particularly within lessons and on the dashboard.
- Use subtle, non-distracting transitions for UI elements and interactive feedback for improved user engagement.
